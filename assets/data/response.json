				"Body":"The social roles theory suggests that social contexts have different gender role expectations and those gender role expectations can maximize or minimize gender differences. For instance, there are three competing hypotheses as to why and in what situations certain people hold doors for others. The gender neutral stance hypothesizes an equal amount of door holding would consistently be done by both sexes for both sexes. Chivalry is associated with male roles and is another hypothesis that predicts that men hold doors open for women as an act of helpfulness. Yet another stance looks at male dominance and how it is expressed in door holding behavior. This stance adds to the social role theory hypothesizing that door holding behaviors will be different depending on the emphasis on gender roles in the social context. The research done by Yoder, Hogue, Newman, Metz and LaVigne (2003) looks at door holding behavior in a dating situation as opposed to everyday life situations, predicting that males will hold open doors more often during a dating situation than in an everyday life situation. Seven hundred and sixty-nine mixed-gender, college-age, male-female pairs were unobtrusively observed in 16 different locations. The locations selected were places where either dating or non-dating couples were most likely to be found. These locations included shopping malls, universities and fast-good restaurants, for non-dating couples, and sit down restaurants and skate rinks, for dating couples. The amount of door holding for the other, either male of female, was measured. In an everyday context 55.2% more women, in the couples observed, held the door open for men than men did for women. In a dating context the reverse was found, 66.8% more men, in the couples observed, held the door open for women than women held the door open for men. This study contradicts studies done about 20 years ago, which suggests that door holding practices and gender roles have changed somewhat over the years in everyday life scenarios but remain similar in dating scenarios. Applying these results to the social role theory also suggests that door holding behavior may be different in dating versus everyday life scenarios because gender roles are more prominent in dating scenarios."

				"Body":"Researchers Yoder, Hogue, Newman, Metz, and LaVigne (2002) conducted a study to determine how gender salience affects door-holding behavior in the contexts of dating and everyday life. They hypothesized that, if door holding is a gender-neutral behavior, men and women would have the same rates of door holding in both contexts. If it is a helping behavior influenced by notions of chivalry, men would have higher rates in both contexts. Lastly, if it is a benevolent sexist behavior, men would have higher rates of door holding during dates than in everyday life. To obtain data for the study, five undergraduate students observed 769 college-age female-male pairs in 16 public places. Seven were everyday locations, pairs were only included in the study if a member of a non-courting pair was observed holding a door for the other member. In the dating locations, pairs were only included if a member of a courting pair exhibited door-holding behavior. The result of the study revealed that, in the context of everyday life, women held the door for men more than men did for women. However, in the dating context, men held the door for women more than women did for men. The data supported the benevolent sexism hypothesis but not the gender-neutral and helping behavior hypotheses. The outcome of this study implied that male door-holding behavior was more likely to occur in the context of dating because gender was more conspicuous. It supported the social role theory that the context variable is an important factor in influencing behavior."

				"Body":"Previous research has indicated that moderator variables influence the role gender differences play in social behavior.  Yoder, Hogue, Newman, Metz, and LaVigne (2003) theorized that social context influences gender differences in door-holding behavior and that there are three possible explanations for such behavior. Door-holding could be an act of courtesy, of chivalry, or of benevolent sexism, a behavior which outwardly seems benign but is motivated by sexism. The purpose of this study was to determine if differences exist in such behavior in the context of everyday life situations compared with dating situations. The researchers hypothesized the courtesy theory would result in data showing equal numbers of men and women opening doors in both situations, the chivalry theory would result in data showing men consistently opening doors for women in both situations, and the benevolent sexism theory would result in data showing men opening doors for women more often in settings which emphasize masculinity and heterosexuality, such as dating situations. In this study, researchers observed the door-holding behavior of 404 college-aged female-male dyads on weekdays at seven everyday locations such as fast food restaurants, and 365 college-aged couples on weekend evenings at nine dating locations such as skating rinks. Only the actions of couples who demonstrated courtship behaviors were recorded at the dating locations, and only the actions of non-couple dyads were recorded at the everyday locations. The researchers would record the gender of the door-holder only when one person opened the door to allow the other person to go through first. The results of the study showed a statistically significant difference between the door-holding behaviors of female-male dyads in everyday life situations versus dating situations. In the observed everyday situations, women held doors open more often than men did. In the observed dating situations, men held doors open more often than women did. The researchers believe these results support their hypothesis that door-holding behavior is motivated by benevolent sexism. Studies of door-holding behavior that were conducted 20 years ago showed that men were most often the door-holders in both everyday and dating situations. The results of the current study suggest that the meaning of such behavior in everyday context has changed from a masculine behavior into a gender-neutral behavior. However, door-holding in the context of dating has retained its masculine motivation. Implications of the study suggest that future research of social behaviors should acknowledge and investigate the role of moderator variables."

				"Body":" In order to describe and explain discrepancies between male and female conduct in social situations, one may look at the context of each situation. The degree of gender awareness that any particular set of circumstances provides may affect people's subsequent behavior in predictable ways. Yoder, Hogue, Newman, Metz, and LaVigne studied door-holding, a possible gender-related behavior, in both dating and everyday settings. They proposed three hypotheses for the three main explanations of door-holding by men for women. Simple politeness as a cause would lead to the same amount of door-holding by men across both settings, a desire to help women would led to more door-holding by men across both settings, and a more sexist explanation would lead to more door-holding by men in the dating setting only.To test these hypotheses, five undergraduates (three female, two male) collected data at sixteen public areas. They observed instances of door-holding in 769 male-female pairs at both everyday and dating locations. At the dating locations, they only counted pairs who appeared to be romantically involved, while at the everyday locations, they only counted pairs who did not appear to be romantically involved. When data-collection ended, they first used a chi-square test. This assured them that the door-holding differences between locations were statistically relevant. Using the chi-square test again, they found that a significantly higher number of women were door-holders for men in the everyday locations. Conversely, a significantly higher number of men were door-holders for women in the dating locations.These results support the idea that a type of benevolent sexism affects the behavior of men towards women in particularly gender-defining situations, such as dating. The tendency for women to hold doors more than men in everyday situations, then, serves to further define the clear difference between men and women's actions in dating. This suggests that using a moderator variable, such as the degree to which a situation may enhance the differences in behavior between genders, will be useful in later social psychology studies."

				"Body":"Research performed by Yoder, Hogue, Newman, Metz and Lavigne (2002) used door holding as a proxy variable to measure gender differences in social situations.  These authors had three competing hypotheses based on door holding as being gender neutral, gender helpful or benevolently sexist.  They felt if door holding was gender neutral, there would be no difference in whether a man or woman held the door in any situation. Likewise, if the act was gender helpful (with helpful being related to chivalry and therefore a more masculine act), men would be more likely to hold the door for women in any situation.  The third hypothesis was door holding as a benevolently sexist act and would show that men would be more likely to hold doors for women while portraying gender specific roles (i.e. heterosexual dating), but would not hold doors as much for women in everyday social situations. Yoder, Hogue, Newman, Metz and Lavigne (2002) designed their experiment to determine which hypothesis better represents male-female behavior.In this experiment, 769 male-female college aged pairs were observed independently by five undergraduate students in both everyday social situations and situations in which they might be portraying gender specific roles (heterosexual dating).  To be included in the study, the pair had to approach the door together and one member (either male or female) had to open the door for the other person.  404 male-female pairs were observed opening doors for each other at 7 different common social areas and were included in the study only if they showed no outward signs of dating.  Alternatively, 365 male-female pairs were observed at 9 traditional dating locations and were only included if they exhibited clear signs of dating.The researchers showed that women hold the door significantly more than men (χ2 (1, N = 404) = 4.37, p=.037), over 55% of the time, in everyday situations. Men, however, held the door significantly more than women ( χ2 (1, N = 365) = 41.45, p < .001), over 66% of the time, while in gender specific roles.  After analyzing the data, the only supported hypothesis was that door holding could be explained as benevolently sexist, meaning that men perceived women much more stereotypically while in gender specific roles and consequently enforced helpful gender stereotypes with more frequency whether or not their actions were controlling.  Yoder, Hogue, Newman, Metz and Lavigne (2002) were able to show that gender relations change due to specific social situations and proxy variables should be used only in their context to define male-female interaction."

				"Body":"Recent studies have sought to determine the strengths of gender stereotypes through social behavior. One study by Yoder, Hogue, Newman, Metz, and LaVigne (2002) investigated how conspicuous gender roles affect the behavior of men and women in daily life.  The study examined the social meaning of door-holding behavior by seeing how the behavior differed in everyday life versus on dates, when gender roles would be emphasized. Yoder et al. based their predictions on three different paradigms.  The gender-neutral stance states that door-holding is a courtesy, and therefore predicts the behavior would be performed equally between the sexes in both conditions.  The helping perspective suggests that door-holding is associated with the masculine concept of chivalry, and predicts that in both everyday life and on dates there would be a pattern of men opening doors for women.  The third perspective maintains that door-holding is a type of benevolent sexism, in which apparently helping behavior reinforces sexist ideals and predicts that men would open doors for women more often in gender-salient conditions, such as on dates, than in everyday life. In this study, 769 college-aged male-female pairs were unobtrusively observed in situations where one of the pair opened a door for the other.  Of these, 404 pairs were observed on weekdays in everyday circumstances while not exhibiting signs of courtship.  The other 365 pairs showed physical signs of courtship, and were observed on Friday and Saturday evenings in dating locations.  It was found that in everyday settings, more females opened the door for males, which was statistically significantly more than males opened for females.  In the dating situations, more men opened doors for women, a complete reversal from everyday situations. Both the gender-neutral paradigm and the helping paradigm predict no statistically significant change in pattern across conditions.  The benevolent sexism hypothesis is congruent with the results that men are more likely to open doors for women in conditions where gender roles are exaggerated. The study suggests that sexism is associated with door-holding.  The pattern of women opening doors more for men in everyday situations suggests that door-holding has lost its masculine, chivalrous connotation, and has become associated with the qualities of politeness and care giving, which are considered to be feminine.  Moreover, the study supports the idea that behavior follows traditional models of benevolent sexism in conditions in which gender roles are more evident."
